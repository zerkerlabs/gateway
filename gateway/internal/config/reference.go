// Package config is the canonical, machine-readable reference for the
// environment variables the Zerker gateway reads.
//
// The gateway has no central config loader — settings are read as scattered
// os.Getenv calls at boot (see cmd/zerker-gateway, internal/auth, internal/kms).
// This package does not change that; it is a hand-maintained *manifest* of
// those variables that two things build on:
//
//   - cmd/gendocs renders Reference into the public config/env reference the
//     product website includes (make docs); and
//   - reference_test.go scans the gateway source for os.Getenv / os.LookupEnv
//     keys and fails if any is missing from (or stale in) Reference — so a new
//     environment variable cannot ship undocumented.
//
// Add a variable here in the same change that introduces it; `make check`
// enforces the pairing.
