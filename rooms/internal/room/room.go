// Package room defines the Room domain model — Room, Member, Message, and
// Event — and the Store interface that persists them. MemoryStore is the
// in-memory implementation.
//
// A room is a durable, membership-scoped space where two or more agents cowork
// a single task. Rooms are single-tenant: every member of a room belongs to the
// same tenant as the room. Cross-tenant rooms are out of scope (a larger
// identity/consent problem), so every store method scopes reads and mutations
// to a tenant and never lets a caller distinguish "belongs to another tenant"
// from "does not exist" (AGENTS.md invariant #2).
//
// A room's history is an append-only event log: every membership change,
// message, and lifecycle transition is appended as an Event, in order. The
// room's transcript is a replay of that log rather than a second structure
// kept in sync with it. A room also carries a turn budget: posting a message
// consumes one turn, and exceeding the budget abandons the room rather than
// letting agents loop indefinitely.
