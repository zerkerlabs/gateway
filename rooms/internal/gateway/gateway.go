// Package gateway provides the client Rooms uses to call one member's agent
// on behalf of another: every agent-to-agent call in Rooms is issued through
// the Zerker gateway's proxy endpoint (POST /v1/proxy/{agt_id}), never
// directly. Routing the call this way means it inherits the gateway's policy
// enforcement, x402 payment gate, and invocation capture for free — Rooms
// does not reimplement any of that, and this package must not grow a direct
// agent-to-agent path.
//
// The proxy endpoint is ASYNCHRONOUS: it returns 202 with an invocation_id as
// soon as the call is accepted, then performs the upstream call server-side.
// A 202 therefore means "accepted", NOT "delivered" — the real outcome is only
// observable by polling GET /v1/proxy/{agt_id}/invocations/{inv_id} until the
// invocation reaches a terminal state. This client polls, because treating the
// 202 as success would report the dominant real failure mode (the recipient
// agent erroring, being unreachable, or timing out) as a delivered message.
//
// The gateway is multi-tenant and derives the acting tenant from the
// credential's claims, so one credential acts for exactly one tenant. Rooms is
// multi-tenant too, so a Client is configured with the tenant its credential
// acts as (Config.Tenant) and refuses any call for a different one. One Rooms
// deployment therefore serves addressed messaging for one gateway tenant; see
// Config.Tenant for what serving several would take.
//
// This package only issues the call and classifies the outcome. Retries,
// streaming, payment handling, and policy logic all live in the gateway.
